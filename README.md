# World_Weather_Analysis
## Summary
Two analyses were done in this project. First, a vacation search was done, which can be found in the "Vacation_Search" folder. This analysis found 175 cities with temperature in the range between 70 and 90 degrees Farenheit, and with a hotel within 5000 meters, using the Geoapify API. These results were then plotted on a world map and saved to a .csv file, both of which can be found in that folder.

The second analysis, which can be found in "Vacation_Itinerary" folder, used these cities to find four which were in the same country. In this case, four cities in Mexico were found. Using these cities, an itinerary was made to route between each city and this itinerary was plotted on a map.
